<h1>There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man’s fears, and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call ...

		 <h2>Some Quotes On Sugar Water</h2>
<br>
		 <ul>
			 <li><p>“Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?” What Steve Jobs said to Pepsi executive John Sculley to lure him to Apple. Sculley mentions it in the documentary Bloomberg Game Changers</p></li>

			 <li><b>Kay</b>: I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life form leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water, do you?</li>
			 <p><b>Jay</b>: Aw that was on Final Jeopardy last night. Come on what did Alex say?</p>

			 <p><b>Kay</b>: Zed, we got a bug.</p></li>

		 	<p>Penang Curry, see also "phanaeng", is a Thai curry which is sweet and salty with a nutty peanut flavor. The best Penang's are at the mercy of their restuarant under the following condition: they serve an appropriate portion of rice to not exceed 2 cups, the protein is sliced (not diced or shredded), the extra <em>filligree</em>, aka vegetables, are steamed not fried, and the restuarant has a Spice Caddy with a vinegar based spice, fish sauce based spice, chili paste, and chili flakes. Oh my, just thinking of it makes my mouth water. Do more of this. <p><em>Note: not all resturants are the same, there are offenders amongst us who not only lack a Spice Caddy but look at you in confusion when you ask for one. <strong>Sriracha is NOT an appropriate substitute...</strong></em></p></p>
